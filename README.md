# Temperature-HumiditySensing_Arduino-Uno
Temperature and Humidity Sensing with Arduino Uno involves using sensors like the DHT11 or DHT22 to measure environmental temperature and humidity. These sensors send digital data to the Arduino Uno, which processes and displays the readings.

Key components:
1. Arduino Uno: The microcontroller that interfaces with the sensor and processes the data.
2. DHT11/DHT22 Sensor: A combined temperature and humidity sensor that outputs digital signals.
3. LCD Display/Serial Monitor: Used to display the measured temperature and humidity values.

Steps involved:
1. Wiring: Connect the sensor to the Arduino (typically with one pin for data, another for power, and one for ground).
2. Programming: Write code using the Arduino IDE, utilizing the DHT sensor library to read data from the sensor.
3. Display: Output the temperature (in Celsius/Fahrenheit) and humidity (as a percentage) on an LCD or through the serial monitor.

This setup is commonly used in weather stations, home automation, and environmental monitoring systems.
